# AI Policy Module v1 (Dec. 2024)
_Updated Feb. 2024_

## About
This first version of the _AI Policy Module_ was created and piloted in December 2024 for a graduate introductory machine learning class, and includes one lecture each on _AI ethics_ and _AI policy_. Our paper about this pilot was accepted at the 2025 American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Annual Conference & Exposition.

## Lecture 2: [Regulating Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/james-weichert/ai-policy-module/blob/main/v1/lecture2.pdf)

The second lecture in the module frames _AI policy_ as the medium through which principles in AI
ethics frameworks are put into practice with code and institutional structures. The goal of this
lecture is to introduce students to the components of policy, influences on how governments and
corporations shape policy, and key nascent government AI regulation.

The centerpiece of this module is the _Congress vs. Evil Inc._ in-class game, modeled off of the popular party game _Mafia_ (also called _Werewolf_). Students assume roles as either members of Congress, leaders of the multinational technology company _Evil Inc._, or voters, and the game emulates the key tensions involved in the policymaking process. The mechanics of the game are described in detail in our ASEE paper.
