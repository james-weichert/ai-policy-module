# _AI Policy Module_ Project

_Updated Nov. 2025_

## About

The _AI Policy Module_ is a multi-lecture curricular unit for computing ethics and technical AI/ML courses designed to familiarize students with the specific ethical challenges precipitated by AI technologies, and to to introduce students to the landscape of policy and regulation—in both the public and private sectors—that is beginning to shape the 'responsibile' use of AI.

The [original version](https://github.com/james-weichert/ai-policy-module/blob/main/v1/ABOUT.md) of the module consists of lectures covering _AI ethics_ and _AI policy_, case studies on the ethical and social impacts of AI systems, and interactive classroom activities (including an in-class game) to engage students in the module's content. This project has two goals:

1. Introduce students to the landscape of AI policy, enabling them to navigate the interplay of AI regulation on their future computing work while reinforcing the centrality of ethical and policy considerations to the AI/ML field.
2. Provide instructors of technical and ethics/'social impacts' computing courses with inspiration for how to integrate discussions about the challenges and risks of AI in their curricula, including through specific case studies, in-class activities, and assignments.

More recently, we adapted the module for a standalone CS ethics course, focusing on policy (in both the public and private sectors) as an embodiment of power and exploring the 'technical frontier' describing what is and what is not (yet) possible with current AI technologies. The [_AI Policy Module_ 2.0](https://github.com/james-weichert/ai-policy-module/blob/main/v2/ABOUT.md) includes a lecture on AI policy and a new assignment on jailbreaking or aligning an AI model.

## Updates

* [Jun '25] Our _AI Policy Module_ 2.0 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15639) was accepted for publication at the 2025 IEEE Frontiers in Education (FIE) Conference in November. [This version](https://github.com/james-weichert/ai-policy-module/blob/main/v2/ABOUT.md) of the module includes an "AI Regulation Assignment" that we are working to make available in the near future!
* [Feb '25] [Our paper]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07931](https://peer.asee.org/educating-a-responsible-ai-workforce-piloting-a-curricular-module-on-ai-policy-in-a-graduate-machine-learning-course) on the first iteration of the _AI Policy Module_ was accepted at the 2025 American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Annual Conference & Exposition.
