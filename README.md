# _AI Policy Module_ Project

_Updated Feb. 2025_

## About

The _AI Policy Module_ is a multi-lecture curricular unit for computing ethics and technical AI/ML courses designed to familiarize students with the specific ethical challenges precipitated by AI technologies, and to to introduce students to the landscape of policy and regulation—in both the public and private sectors—that is beginning to shape the 'responsibile' use of AI.

The [module](https://github.com/james-weichert/ai-policy-module/blob/main/v1/ABOUT.md) consists of lectures covering _AI ethics_ and _AI policy_, case studies on the ethical and social impacts of AI systems, and interactive classroom activities (including an in-class game) to engage students in the module's content. This project has two goals:

1. Introduce students to the landscape of AI policy, enabling them to navigate the interplay of AI regulation on their future computing work while reinforcing the centrality of ethical and policy considerations to the AI/ML field.
2. Provide instructors of technical and ethics/'social impacts' computing courses with inspiration for how to integrate discussions about the challenges and risks of AI in their curricula, including through specific case studies, in-class activities, and assignments.

## Updates

* We are busy developing an _AI Policy Module_ 2.0 to pilot in a graduate computing ethics course this spring. Version 2 of the module will include more case studies, in-class activities, and an out-of-class group assignment on AI regulation.
* Our paper on the first iteration of the _AI Policy Module_ was accepted at the 2025 American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Annual Conference & Exposition.
