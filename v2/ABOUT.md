# AI Policy Module v2 (Mar. 2025)
_Updated Jun. 2025_

## About
The second iteration of the _AI Policy Module_ was piloted in March 2025 for a standalone graduate CS ethics course. This version was spread across three lectures over two weeks of class. [Our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15639) on this updated version, which includes a technical assignment on AI regulation, was accepted at the 2025 IEEE Frontiers in Education (FIE) Conference.

### Discussion Topics

**From Ethical Principles to Practices**
* Ethical principles comprise AI ethics frameworks (e.g., [Floridi and Cowls 2019](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/l0jsh9d1/release/8))
* Need to translate from ethical _principles_ to responsible AI _practices_ ([Schiff et al. 2020a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04707), [Kim et al. 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10155067))

**AI Policy**
* What is AI policy? ([Calo 2017](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk15026/files/media/documents/51-2_Calo.pdf))
* Who 'does' policy? ([Schiff et al. 2020b](https://doi.org/10.1145/3375627.3375804))
* Policy influences ([Floridi 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-019-00354-x), [Schiff et al. 2020b](https://doi.org/10.1145/3375627.3375804), [Auld et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2022.2099449), [Parinandi et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1017/bap.2023.40))
